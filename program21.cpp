/*
components of stl 

containers  ->
all ready implemented classes
objects which stores the data

algorithms  ->
sorting .
searching. 
algorithm use by tamplated functions.

itretors  ->
 points to a to an elememts in a container. 
 just like pointers but its is a objects.
 connect algorithm with contianers.
 connect algorithms with containers.

containers 

objects which stores a data

tree types 
  1 sequence containers->

  thay stores data in linear fasion sequence form .

  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 ->5 
  eg 
  vectors 
  list 
  deqeue 

  2 associative containers ->

      thay are used for direct acees
      fast acces fast insertion deletion 



    eg
    map 
    multimap 
    set 
    multiset
    dictionery

     

  3 derived containerd 

  for use real modeling

  eg 

  stack 
  queue
  privority queue





vector 

random acess is fast

insertion deletion is slow 

insertion at the and is fast
